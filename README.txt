This bot was going to be used to make gold on Diablo 3 using the auction house. I never finished the bot (lost interest in the game), but I did finish the image matching part of it. I have a small image of each digit (screenshoted from diablo 3) and a simple pattern matching is used to find all numbers in a given larger image. Boyre-Moore matching algorithm is not yet implemented but would have been the next step for the bot to work in realtime
